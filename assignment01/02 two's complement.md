two's complement - why we use it:

notes from wiki read on two's complement 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement#:~:text=Two's%20complement%20is%20a%20mathematical,method%20of%20signed%20number%20representation.&text=In%20other%20words%2C%20to%20reverse,complement%20of%20its%20binary%20representation.

>"for the three-bit number 010, the two's complement is 110, because 010 + 110 = 8 which is equal to 23. The two's complement is calculated by inverting the digits and adding one"

>"Two's complement is the most common method of representing signed integers on computers" ... "In this scheme, if the binary number 0102 encodes the signed integer 210, then its two's complement, 1102, encodes the inverse: −210. In other words, to reverse the sign of most integers (all but one) in this scheme, you can take the two's complement of its binary representation"
